# MERN Stack Authentication Project

This project is a demonstration of implementing authentication using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes.

## Features

- User login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication
- Protected routes accessible only to authenticated users
- Password hashing for security (bcrypt) 
- Logout functionality

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information.
- Express.js: A backend framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- React.js: A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code execution.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for secure authentication.
- bcryptjs: A library for hashing passwords.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- Docker: A containerization platform used for easy deployment and scalability.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without writing CSS.
